## Requirements

Node.js >= 20 ( LTS )  
A couchDB database (https://app.osaas.io/dashboard/service/apache-couchdb)  
An S3 Storage (https://app.osaas.io/dashboard/service/minio-minio)

## Installation / Usage

Install dependencies

```
pnpm install
```

Create an .env file based on the .env.sample file in the root of the project. Add to it:

```
DB_URL=<DB_URL>
DB_USERNAME=<DB_USERNAME>
DB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=<S3_ENDPOINT_URL>
S3_BUCKET=<S3_BUCKET>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
API_TOKEN=<API_TOKEN>
```

`S3_BUCKET` must already exist; the gateway allocates object keys within it and
never creates buckets.

Optional variables: `PORT` (default `8000`), `AWS_REGION` (default
`eu-north-1`), `CORS_ORIGIN` (comma-separated allowlist), `LOG_LEVEL`,
`ENABLE_UI` (default `true`, serves the inspector UI at `/ui`), `HLS_URL_TTL`
(default `21600`, presigned segment-URL lifetime in seconds for HLS output),
`LIVE_RECENCY_WINDOW` (default `30`, seconds within which the latest segment marks
a flow live), `LIVE_WINDOW_SEC` (default `300`, span in seconds of the live
HLS playlist DVR window ending at the live edge) and `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default
`5000`, per-webhook delivery timeout in milliseconds for outbound event POSTs).

If you are using the couchDB and Minio services from OSC then this file will look like:

```
DB_URL=<LINK TO OSC COUCHDB SERVICE>
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=<AdminPassword>
S3_ENDPOINT_URL=<LINK TO OSC MINIO SERVICES>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<RootUSer> //Set when creating OSC Minio Service
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<RootPassword> //Set when creating OSC Minio Service
```

To start TAMS-Gateway

```
pnpm start
```

The API is then running on http://localhost:8000

## Development

To start TAMS-Gateway in development mode

```
pnpm dev
```

The API is then running on http://localhost:8000

## API

Once the server is running, interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is
available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

The gateway exposes the TAMS resources:

| Method & path                                    | Description                                               |

| `GET /service/webhooks`                          | List registered webhooks                                  |

| `PUT /service/webhooks/{webhookId}`              | Update a webhook                                          |

Segments are time-addressed using the TAMS timerange format
`[<seconds>:<nanoseconds>_<seconds>:<nanoseconds>)` (TAI). On startup the
gateway creates the required CouchDB databases and the segment index
automatically.

`GET /flows/{id}/segments` is paged: pass `limit` to cap the page size, and follow
the `Link: <...>; rel="next"` response header (or pass the `X-Paging-NextKey` value
back as the `page` query parameter) to read the next page. Responses also carry
`X-Paging-Limit`, `X-Paging-Count`, `X-Paging-Reverse-Order` and `X-Paging-Timerange`.

## HLS output

`GET /flows/{id}/output.m3u8` synthesises an HLS media playlist on the fly from a
flow's MPEG-TS segments, so any TS flow is directly playable in a standard HLS
client (hls.js, Safari, Omakase Player, ...). Segment URIs are presigned object
URLs served straight from the store.

- `?type=vod`: a complete playlist ending with `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`.
- `?type=live`: the latest segments at the live edge, no end tag, advancing on
  reload. When `type` is omitted the gateway picks live/VOD heuristically; pass it
  explicitly for predictable behaviour.
- `?timerange=[start_end)` restricts to a window; `?limit=N` caps the segment count.

Only MPEG-TS (H.264/AAC) flows are playable; others return `415`. Browser playback
also needs a CORS policy on the object store allowing `GET` + `Range` from the
player origin.

## Webhooks (event notifications)

The gateway can notify external services of changes via webhooks (TAMS event
notifications). Register a webhook with `POST /service/webhooks`:

```json
{
  "url": "https://hook.example.com",
  "api_key_name": "Authorization",
  "api_key_value": "Bearer <token>",
  "events": ["flows/created", "flows/segments_added"]
}
```

The gateway then POSTs a JSON body `{ event_timestamp, event_type, event }` to the
registered `url` for each subscribed event, setting the `api_key_name` header to
`api_key_value` when both are given. Supported event types: `flows/created`,
`flows/updated`, `flows/deleted`, `flows/segments_added`, `sources/created`,
`sources/updated` (and `flows/segments_deleted`, `sources/deleted` once their
triggering operations land). Delivery can be scoped with the `flow_ids` /
`source_ids` filters. The `api_key_value` secret is stored but never returned by
any `GET`. Whether webhooks are supported is advertised in
`event_stream_mechanisms` on `GET /service`.

Delivery is best-effort with a per-webhook timeout (`WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_MS`); a slow
or failing subscriber never blocks or fails the API request that triggered the
event. As a basic SSRF mitigation, delivery to non-HTTP(S) URLs and the cloud
metadata address is refused.

## Inspector UI

A built-in, read-only inspector is served at `/ui` (enabled by default; set
`ENABLE_UI=false` to disable). It browses sources, flows and segments with native
local timestamps, and plays a flow with an embedded HLS player (`-10s`/`+10s`
jumps, a local wall-clock readout, and a "behind live" indicator). It only ever
issues `GET` requests. When the UI is enabled, a browser hitting the root `/` is
redirected to it, while API clients (JSON `Accept`) still get the root-paths
response. The inspector inherits the deployment's auth (it is not public), so it is
directly reachable when the gateway runs standalone or behind a browser-friendly
gate.

## Authentication

When `API_TOKEN` is set, every route except the liveness (`/`), readiness
(`/readiness`) and docs (`/docs`) endpoints requires a bearer token:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>
```

`API_TOKEN` is **optional**. When it is set, the gateway enforces the bearer
token itself. When it is unset, the gateway does not enforce its own auth and
expects authentication to be handled by an upstream authenticating proxy / access
gate in front of it. To avoid an accidentally unprotected deployment, the gateway
logs a warning at startup when it runs with `NODE_ENV=production` and no
`API_TOKEN` set; make sure a gate is in front in that case.

### Which layer authenticates

- **Behind an access gate (e.g. on OSC): leave `API_TOKEN` unset.** The OSC ingress
  gate authenticates callers by validating a Service Access Token (SAT) on the
  `Authorization` header before the request reaches the gateway, so the gateway's
  own bearer check is redundant. Importantly, if `API_TOKEN` _is_ set in this
  setup, the gateway would reject SAT-carrying requests (the SAT value is not the
  `API_TOKEN`), so it must be left unset and the gate is the enforcing layer.
- **Standalone (no gate): set `API_TOKEN`** (or use another auth mode). Here the
  gateway's own bearer is the primary, enforcing layer.
